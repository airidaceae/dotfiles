# If set, mako will save notifications that have reached their timeout into the history buffer instead of immediately deleting them. max-history determines the size of the history buffer.

# Arrange mako at the specified layer, relative to normal windows. Supported values are background, bottom, top, and overlay. Using overlay will cause notifications to be displayed above fullscreen windows, though this may also occur at top depending on your compositor.
